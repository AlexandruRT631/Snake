# Snake
Snake prototype made in october 2019

Small prototype of snake made in visual studio, using the sfml library, made sometime when I was bored. It's controlled using WASD

## Problems
- The input isn't responsive enough, probably due to the locked framerate and checking the input once every 1/60 seconds.
- Locked framerate
- After game over, the game closes
